# Contributing to SchoolHard

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Azure
We use Azure to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use Azure Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Azure's issues
We use Azure issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
We will add an example of a good bug report in the future. For now, try to provide as much detail as possible when reporting bugs.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* We use Kotlin coding conventions

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
