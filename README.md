# SchoolHard

## Description
SchoolHard is an Android app designed to replace SchoolSoft. While it continues to use the SchoolSoft API, it implements its own user interface along with an on-device caching database. This allows it to load faster and function offline, providing a more user-friendly and reliable experience.

## Features
* Custom user interface for easier navigation
* On-device caching database for faster loading
* Offline functionality
* Seamless integration with SchoolSoft's API
