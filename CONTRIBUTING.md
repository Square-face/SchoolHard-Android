# Contributing to SchoolHard on GitHub

We welcome your contributions to our project on GitHub! We want to make the contribution process as easy and transparent as possible, whether you're interested in:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Contribution Workflow with GitHub Pull Requests

To propose changes to the codebase, we encourage the use of GitHub pull requests. Here's how you can contribute:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from the `main` branch.
2. If your changes include code that should be tested, please provide the necessary test cases.
3. If you've made modifications to APIs, don't forget to update the project's documentation accordingly.
4. Ensure that the test suite passes without any errors.
5. Finally, submit your pull request, and our team will review it.

## Licensing

When you submit code changes, please be aware that your contributions will be governed by the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. If you have any concerns about this, feel free to contact our project maintainers.

## Reporting Bugs on GitHub Issues

To report bugs, we use GitHub issues to keep track of them. Reporting a bug is simpleâ€”just open a new issue!

## Writing Detailed Bug Reports

While we plan to add an example of an excellent bug report in the future, for now, we kindly request that you provide as much detail as possible when reporting bugs. This includes background information and, if applicable, sample code.

## Maintaining a Consistent Coding Style

Please follow these coding style guidelines when contributing to our project:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation instead of tabs.
- Adhere to Kotlin coding conventions.
